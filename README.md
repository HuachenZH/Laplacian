# Laplacian
Solve 2nd order differential equation with Laplacian operator
A scholarly project. Solve differential equations with a numerical approach.
You can find two folders :
School : solve the equation in the way that the school taught us. It's easy but not so powerful, and it needs too much time to change parameters if we change the equation and the size of model.
Gauss-Seidel : solve the equation with iterative Gauss-Seidel approach. Much more powerful! However it takes long time to compute.
